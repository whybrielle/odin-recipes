    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="centered-list">
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place sliced apples in a 9x13-inch baking dish.
            Mix white sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, and cinnamon together; sprinkle over apples. Pour water evenly over apples.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine oats, 1 cup flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl. 
            Add melted butter and mix with a fork until crumbly; sprinkle evenly over apple mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until apple filling is bubbling, and top is golden brown, crisp, and caramelized around the edges, about 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drizzle with caramel sauce.
        </li>
    </ol>
